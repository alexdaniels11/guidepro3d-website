				<p>With more than 10 years of experience in placing implants and teaching dentists how to place implants, Dr. Thompson came up with an idea for mechanical ways to derive The Perfect Restorative Trajectory for implant surgery. After further research and sharing his idea with his dental school classmate and friend, Dr. Crandall, the pair evolved the idea for its betterment – a software program that enables dentists to plan an implant case and print that “recipe” on an in-office 3D printer – GuidePro3D.</p>
